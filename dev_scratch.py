"""This file contains code in development and is meant to try out concepts or just play around with ideas... alright, at
this point it has become mostly a dumping ground for 'todos'."""

# Old TODOS from console times that could still be good to keep in mind when migrating that part over to PyGame:
# TODO figure out how to implement different attacks with spear in 'item_instance.py'
# TODO Equip/unequip methods work only for armor right now in 'character_model.py'

# TODOS:
# TODO add sections for thief skills to character sheet
# TODO add option to allow for minor customization of randomly generated characters
# TODO confirmation messages for save/load screen
# TODO perhaps rename 'gui_elements' stuff to 'ui_registry'
# TODO clean up imports via '__init__.py' files
# TODO set 'is_saved' attribute to 'False' when currently active and saved character has been deleted, so confirmation
#   message will be triggered when leaving character sheet screen.
