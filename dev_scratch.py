"""This file contains code in development and is meant to try out concepts or just play around with ideas... alright, at
this point it has become mostly a dumping ground for 'todos'."""

# Old TODOS from console times that could still be good to keep in mind when migrating that part over to PyGame:
# TODO figure out how to implement different attacks with spear in 'item_instance.py'
# TODO Equip/unequip methods work only for armor right now in 'character_model.py'
# TODO fully implement weapons shop within 'shop_functions.py'

# Shit to keep in mind:
# TODO keep an eye on functions in 'core\rules.py' and 'character_creation_functions.py' that will be obsolete after migration.
# TODO Remove function call 'build_character_sheet()' from event handler when final character sheet is done.
# TODO pop-up texts overlap with underlying text on some screens.

# PRIORITIES:
# TODO finish character sheet screen ffs!!!
# TODO add similar adaptability from 'ability scores screen' to other screens where it might apply
# TODO Re-structure 'rules.py' and 'Character' class to get rid of overlap
