The Magic-User/Thief is a cunning and elusive character, merging the arcane arts with the skills of subterfuge and stealth. These individuals use their magical knowledge to enhance their thieving capabilities, making them unpredictable and dangerous in a world that underestimates them.

Magic-User/Thieves are proficient in casting spells while wearing leather armor, enabling them to maintain some protection without sacrificing their magical abilities. This makes them more resilient than pure Magic-Users, though they remain less hardy than Fighters. Their magical skills can be used to supplement their thievery, whether by disarming traps with a mystical touch, charming their marks, or becoming invisible to evade capture.

The Prime Requisites for Magic-User/Thieves are Intelligence and Dexterity; a character must have an Intelligence score of 9 or higher and a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to pursue this class. They may use any weapon and wear leather armor, but like pure Magic-Users, they may not don metal armor or use shields. A first-level Magic-User/Thief begins with a spellbook containing read magic and one additional first-level spell, allowing them to embark on their adventures with both magical and practical tools at their disposal.
