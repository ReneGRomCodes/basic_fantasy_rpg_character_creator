DWARVES

Description: Dwarves are a short, stocky race; both
male and female Dwarves stand around four feet tall
and typically weigh around 120 pounds. Their long
hair and thick beards are dark brown, gray or black.
They take great pride in their beards, sometimes
braiding or forking them. They have a fair to ruddy
complexion. Dwarves have stout frames and a strong,
muscular build. They are rugged and resilient, with the
capacity to endure great hardships. Dwarves are
typically practical, stubborn and courageous. They can
also be introspective, suspicious and possessive. They
have a lifespan of three to four centuries.

Restrictions: Dwarves may become Clerics, Fighters,
or Thieves. They are required to have a minimum
Constitution of 9. Due to their generally dour
dispositions, they may not have a Charisma higher than
17. They may not employ Large weapons more than
four feet in length (specifically, two-handed swords,
polearms, and longbows).

before this roll may be made.
